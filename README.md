============

Unnamed Psychological horror game currently in planning stage. possibly cross-platform.

Will be created using C++ possibly utilizing Clanlib.

The game will be as stated a Psychological horror game that will be based around events that happened to someone in real life, only taken surreal extreme.

You will be playing the character "Lewis" who has had a severe physcological break down, you are left in the dark as to what caused this breakdown, you wake up in the mental ward of a run down hospital.
All you know is that you are Lewis, aged 24 living in a remote northern Canadian town of about 3500, no family that you know of, but for some reason the name "Chloe" is repeating over and over in your head, and you cant seem to get it out.

You try to move, but are heavily restrained, all you hear are loud screams, banging on walls, doors, counters, etc. and a faint but definitely there "chirping" noise. You picture a bird in your head, and briefly that brings a smile to your face, when suddenly the bird is smashed by a baseball bat into the pavement, this jolts you out of your daze and back to harsh reality.
